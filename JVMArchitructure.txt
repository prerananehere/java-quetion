                                         JVM(java virchual machine)

there are two types of virchual machine
1.system/hardware base                 2.application /process base
ex-xen cloud coumputing,kvm             ex-jvm(run java application)
                                           pvm( scripting language like perl)
                                           clr(common language runtime , run net base application)
