OOPS
there are four main types of oops
1.INHERITANCE
2.ABSTACTION
3.ENCAPSULATION
4.POLYMORPHISM

.INHERITANCE
one object aquaring all properties and behavier from parent object.

there are 5 types of inheritance
1.SINGLE INHERITANCE
in single level inheritance having only parent and child
 class A
   |
 class B

2.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
in multilevel inheritance having one child class and more than one parent class at different level
class A(grandparent)
  |
class B(Parent)
  |
class C(child)

3.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
in multiple inheritance having one child and morethan one parent class at a same level

class A      class B
  \          /
    class C
    (child)
(NOT SUPPORT IN JAVA)
multiple inheritance not support in java because of diamond problem child class get ambiquatic siatuation/confusion which
parent class method, consrtuctor call.

4.Herarichal inheritance
  In herarhicle inheritance having more than one child class and having only one parent class

               
class A      class B
  \          /
    class C
    (parent)
5. HYBRIDE INTERFACE 
 it is a combination of two inheritance
class B         class C
       \         /
         class A
         /     \
  class D     class E
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTACTION
hiding implimentation & showing only functionality
EXAMPLE-
  in atm machine bank people show only functionality and hiding implimentation we can see withrow recipt etc option 
  on screen but we cant see what is interanal working behind them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENCAPSULATION
 wrapping a data and its behaviour in a single unit is called encapsulation.
security is a main advantage of encapsulation.
disadvantage- increase line of code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POLYMORPHISM
polymorphism means many forms 
there are two types of polymorphism 
     
                 polymorphism

  1.static                           2.dynamic                
we can achive static polymrphism     we can acheive at runtime
at compiletime
 it also called as compiletime       it also called as runtime polymorphism
 polymorphism 
we can acheive compiletime           we can acheive runtime polymorphism with 
polymorphism by overloading           overriding method
method

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
overloading                               overriding
.we can create multiple method              we can override all parent class properties  
of same name in same class                  in child class
. method name must be same                  method name must be same
.argument type must be different            argument type must be same

. return type doesnt have any rule         return time must be same until 1.4v but 1.5v 
                                            onwords covarient return type is allow

.private, static, final method can be        cannot be overridden
overloaded

                                            the scope of access modifier cannot decrease,
. no restriction on access modifier                        we can increase

.compiletime static polymorphism              runtime dynamic polymorphism

.early binding                               late binding
