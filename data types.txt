                                    .DATA TYPES 
There are two types
1. primititive data type                                       2. non primitive data type
 
1.In primitive data types there are 8 types                         |

1.byte(1 byte)                                                      class
2.short(2 bytes)                                                    interface
3.int(4 bytes)                                                      arrays
4.long(8 bytes)
5.float(4 bytes)                                                     string
6.double(8 bytes)->0.0,10.0)
7.boolean (1 byte true/flse)
8.char(2 bytes)->(a,b,c,...z)

There are 8 types of wrapper class
1.Byte                                                    
2.Short                                               
3.Integer                                                   
4.Long
5.Float                                                
6.Double
7.Boolean 
8.Character

AUTOBOXING
Conversion of primitive data type to wrapper class is called as autoboxing.

UNBOXING
conversion of wrapper class to primitive data type is called as unboxing


IMPLICTI TYPE CASTING
conversion of small data type to larger data type is called as implicit type casting(widdning)
byte-short
          \
            int-long-float-double
        /
  char
   
EXPLICITE TYPE CASTING
conversion of large data type to small data type is called as explicit type casting (narrowing)
                               char
                              /
    double-float - long- int 
                              \
                             short -byte
in explicite type casting chance of data loosing
